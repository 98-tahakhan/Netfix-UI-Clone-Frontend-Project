# Netflix UI Clone – Frontend Project

This project is a responsive and interactive **Netflix landing page UI clone**, built using **HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.

The goal of this project is to practice real-world frontend development concepts such as layout structuring, responsiveness, accessibility, and controlled UI interactions — similar to how production landing pages are built.

## ♿ Accessibility

## 🧠 Design & Development Decisions

### Why this is a static UI project
This project focuses purely on **frontend UI and interactions**.  
No backend, authentication, or API integration is included in this version.

The intention is to:
- Build a visually accurate and stable UI
- Keep the codebase simple and readable
- Avoid fake or misleading functionality

---

### Why some features are planned for future versions
Building a product like Netflix is an iterative process.  
Features such as authentication, dynamic data, or backend integration take time and are better added gradually.

Planned future improvements may include:
- Email validation and storage
- Dynamic content rendering
- Backend/API integration
- Framework-based version (React)

This version represents a **solid foundation**, not a finished product.
